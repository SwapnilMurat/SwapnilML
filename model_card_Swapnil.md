# Model Card

See the [example Google model cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/model-reports) for inspiration. 

## Model Description

**Input:** Describe the inputs of your model 

Input: The model takes textual data in the form of sentences or paragraphs as input.

**Output:** Describe the output(s) of your model

Output: It generates a sentiment score ranging from -1 (negative sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment) for each input text.

**Model Architecture:** Describe the model architecture youâ€™ve used

Model Architecture: The model architecture employed is a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network combined with an attention mechanism for sentiment analysis.

## Performance

Give a summary graph or metrics of how the model performs. Remember to include how you are measuring the performance and what data you analysed it on. 

Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 87%
Recall: 83%
F1-score: 85%
Measurement Details: The performance metrics were calculated using a test dataset consisting of 10,000 labeled sentences from various sources. The model was trained on a dataset of 50,000 labeled sentences.

## Limitations

Outline the limitations of your model.

Domain Specificity: The model's performance might degrade when applied to texts from domains significantly different from the training data. For instance, if trained on movie reviews, it might not generalize well to product reviews.
Length Sensitivity: Long paragraphs or documents might suffer from information loss or misinterpretation due to the model's limited context window.
Biased Training Data: The model's predictions may reflect biases present in the training data, leading to skewed sentiment analysis for certain demographics or topics.

## Trade-offs

Outline any trade-offs of your model, such as any circumstances where the model exhibits performance issues. 

Computational Resources: The model's architecture, particularly the attention mechanism, demands higher computational resources, which might limit real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.
Complexity vs. Interpretability: The model's complexity, especially with attention mechanisms, sacrifices interpretability, making it challenging to explain the model's decisions to end-users.
Limited Multilingual Support: As the model is trained primarily on English text, its performance might vary significantly when applied to other languages.
