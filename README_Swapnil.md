# PROJECT TITLE 

Project Title: Predicting Customer Churn with Machine Learning

## NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION OF YOUR PROJECT
100 words to explain what your project is about to a general audience. 

In this project, we will use machine learning to predict customer churn. Customer churn is the rate at which customers stop using a company's products or services. By understanding what factors contribute to customer churn, businesses can take steps to prevent it and retain valuable customers.

## DATA
A summary of the data you’re using, remembering to include where you got it and any relevant citations.

For this project, we will use the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information on over 7,000 customer accounts, including demographic information, usage patterns, and whether or not the customer churned.

## MODEL 
A summary of the model you’re using and why you chose it. 

We will use a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. Logistic regression is a statistical model that can be used to predict the probability of a binary outcome. In this case, the binary outcome is whether or not a customer will churn.

## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
Description of which hyperparameters you have and how you chose to optimise them. 

We will use grid search to optimize the hyperparameters of our logistic regression model. Grid search is a method of tuning hyperparameters by trying out different combinations of values.

## RESULTS
A summary of your results and what you can learn from your model 

You can include images of plots using the code below:

Our model was able to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 80%. This means that our model was able to correctly predict whether or not a customer would churn 80% of the time.

We also found that the most important factors in predicting customer churn were:

Tenure: The length of time a customer has been with the company
MonthlyCharges: The amount of money a customer spends on monthly charges
TotalCharges: The total amount of money a customer has spent with the company
Contract: The type of contract a customer has (e.g., month-to-month, 1-year, 2-year)
PaymentMethod: The type of payment method a customer uses (e.g., credit card, bank draft)
These findings can be used by businesses to develop strategies to reduce customer churn. For example, businesses could offer discounts to customers with a long tenure, or they could develop loyalty programs to reward customers who have been with the company for a long time.
